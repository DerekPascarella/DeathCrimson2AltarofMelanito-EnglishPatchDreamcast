"Death Crimson 2: Altar of Melanito" (デスクリムゾン２ −メラニートの祭壇−) is a sequel to the original "Death Crimson" game on the SEGA Saturn. Unlike its predecessor, the sequel features a full story mode, fleshing out the backstory behind the game's numerous characters, while also introducing new ones.
<br><br>
It’s important to note that "Death Crimson 2: Altar of Melanito" stands in stark contrast to "Death Crimson OX", which saw a Western release but completely stripped out the free-roaming story mode.
<br><br>
Players can use either the standard Dreamcast controller or light gun during the shooting sections of the game.

Note that "Death Crimson 2: Altar of Melanito" leverages "tank controls" similar to popular survival horror games.
<br><br>
It's suggested that players use a standard controller to navigate "Story Mode" while using a light gun only for shooting stages. Note that either the controller or the light gun can be inserted into ports 1 and 2, with both being available at any time during the game.

<h2>Progress Saving System</h2>
"Death Crimson 2: Altar of Melanito" provides players with five individudal slots to which game progress can be saved throughout "Story Mode". There also exists a sixth auto-save slot, which always holds a player's most recent progress. This sixth slot cannot be manually written to in any way.

<h2>Bonus Content</h2>
<img align="right" width="267" src="https://github.com/DerekPascarella/DeathCrimson2AltarofMelanito-EnglishPatchDreamcast/blob/main/images/bonus.gif?raw=true">Unique and brand-new for this patch is a collection of bonus content for players to enjoy. To access this material, select "BONUS CONTENT" from the title screen menu, which will launch a <a href="https://www.dreamcast-talk.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=14611">modified version of the Dream Passport web browser</a>.
<br><br>
To return to the game from the bonus content section, press the L or R trigger buttons on the controller, then select "EXIT TO GAME".

</ul>

<h2>Cheat Function</h2>
A brand-new cheat function was implemented for this English translation patch to aid players who are interested in experiencing the story of "Death Crimson 2: Altar of Melanito" without being forced to replay numerous difficult stages repeatedly.
<br><br>
To take advantage of this new feature, at any point during shooting gameplay or free-roaming gameplay, a player can simultaneously press the L and R trigger buttons once. The following real-time cheats will be applied.
<br><br>
<ul>
 <li>Credit count will be reset to 255.</li>
 <li>Any countdown clock will be reset to 15 minutes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Voice Recording Feature</h2>
<img align="right" width="169" height="225" src="https://github.com/DerekPascarella/DeathCrimson2AltarofMelanito-EnglishPatchDreamcast/blob/main/images/microphone.jpg?raw=true">
"Death Crimson 2: Altar of Melanito" features unique support for the Dreamcast microphone. Players have the ability to record three, three-second voice clips to be played back during the game whenever the player sustains damage.
<br><br>
To access the voice recording feature, navigate to "OPTIONS" from the title screen menu. From there, select "Damage Voice Settings", then "Record voice clip". Note that one can also choose to use the built-in voice clips for either Kou, Yuri, or Pat.
<br><br>
Players are given the choice between recording voice data in either 8-bit or 16-bit PCM samples, the latter of the two consuming more space on the VMU.

<h2>Original Soundtrack</h2>
<img align="right" width="168" height="165" src="https://github.com/DerekPascarella/DeathCrimson2AltarofMelanito-EnglishPatchDreamcast/blob/main/images/ost.jpg?raw=true">Along with the game's release on November 25th, 1999, an original soundtrack was sold under the title "Death Crimson 2 - Yuri Rosenberg". The soundtrack features 15 individual tracks, all of which can be heard throughout the Dreamcast game itself.
<br><br>
To learn more about the soundtrack, including credits for songwriters, music arrangers, and vocalists, visit its entry on <a href="https://vgmdb.net/album/9438">VGMdb</a>.
<br><br>
To coincide with the release of this English translation patch, this soundtrack was procured from Japan (read more in <a href="https://twitter.com/DerekPascarella/status/1752792117070504093">this Twitter post</a>) and is available for <a href="https://mega.nz/folder/CM1lRA6S#S3TsOjU2tMOdYOEQrgfClA">download</a> in FLAC, MP3, and OGG formats.

<h2>A Note for CD-R Users</h2>
<img align="right" width="267" height="200" src="https://github.com/DerekPascarella/DeathCrimson2AltarofMelanito-EnglishPatchDreamcast/blob/main/images/cdi.jpg?raw=true">A tremendous amount of additional modification and testing was done for this patch in order to provide those burning to disc (and not using an ODE or emulator) the smoothest possible gaming experience.
<br><br>
"Death Crimson 2: Altar of Melanito" is very read-heavy in terms of how it seeks and streams data from the disc. This becomes particularly aggressive during FMV playback, especially when dual FMV and audio streaming occurs (as is the case in several cutscenes).
<br><br>
Previous CDI releases of the game handled this horribly, with no optimizations in place in order to mitigate out-of-sync audio/video. For this English translation patch, great care has gone into encoding audio/video so that a moderately healthy GD-ROM drive will be able to read and stream this data without excessive synchronization issues.
<br><br>
However, players must bare in mind that despite said optimizations, experiencing this game via CD-R will still be suboptimal. Players will notice a moment or two where on-screen subtitles do not perfectly align with spoken dialogue. Please recognize that this is not a bug, but in fact a limitation of the Dreamcast's CD-ROM reading speed.

<h2>A Note on Light Gun Compatibility</h2>
<img align="right" width="200" height="200" src="https://github.com/DerekPascarella/DeathCrimson2AltarofMelanito-EnglishPatchDreamcast/blob/main/images/lightgun.jpg?raw=true">In the past, it's been reported that "Death Crimson 2: Altar of Melanito" suffers from compatibility problems when using a European Dreamcast with certain video cables and/or certain light guns. During the development of this patch, numerous people helped to test and verify certain claims, while dispelling others. That said, many console/cable/light gun combinations remain untested. It's worth noting that the <a href="https://www.dreammods.net/lightconn.html">LightConn</a> is among the list of incompatible light guns, regardless of console region and cable type.
<br><br>
If players find a working or non-working hardware combination not present on the compatibility matrix below, it's asked that they submit them <a href="https://dreamcastforever.com/?page=contact_information">via email</a>.
<br><br>
If possible, these compatibility issues with be debugged and fixed in a future version of this English translation patch. However, without physical development kit hardware, this task remains highly difficult.
